D3 books: building professional charts
==============
A community-driven [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) cookbook in a very early stage about building professional-grade charts.

#Roadmap
* Writing the best set of charts we can using the [reusable API](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) and the upcoming [d3.v3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/tree/3.0)
* Thoroughly documenting the code and the design choices on the [wiki](https://github.com/biovisualize/d3-charts-book/wiki).
* Start writing a tutorial explaining how to build your own set of charts with D3.
* Developing the tutorial until it's ready to be edited as a book.
* [PACKT publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) will most likely publish a version in a 300 pages cookbook, providing some funding for the editing work.
